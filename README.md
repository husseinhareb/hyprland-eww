With eww i created a topbar made of multiple independent widgets.
From the left the first widget is a clock with weather condition. Next to it is a small spotify widget for easy access to toggling songs and such, it also shows the artwork of the song being played. At the middle is a widget to open apps very easily in this one i've put the apps that i most use. They can be changed by changing the icon and tweaking the app scripts a little on the right there's multiple widget to read mic, speakers,brightness and other things.

The option button at the end is used to open the dashboard(shown below)

The dashboard contains a variety number of widgets.Starting from the left a widget that displays your chosen profile picture and the uptime of the computer, then there's multiple small widgets to open my favorite websites and a big spotify widget, right under it three widgets to check the time,the date and to open your favorite apps.Adding to that also multiple small widgets for power options and lastly on the right two widgets,one to monitor your resources and the other is toggle and change the mic,brightness and the audio volume.
